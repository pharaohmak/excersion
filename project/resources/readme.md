Excursion Project Solution

Compare your work to the official solution!

You can download the solution code to the Excursion project here <https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/project-solutions/F1U3P1_solution.zip>.

Try not to peek at the solution code until you’ve completed this part of the project, or unless you’re really stuck and your struggle has become totally unproductive. Looking at the code before that moment will deprive you of an important learning opportunity and will make it harder for you to achieve your ultimate outcome.
